## How To Use

You can build the project using Visual Studio (full version), then you need to insert additional tools in the same foldere of the .exe launcher file, or you can use the prebuild exe in the repository. Check out the code to change the file paths needed for some features


Through the Legion Launcher you can press a simple key to optimize your performance, clean Logs, Cache, apply Fixes and change Windows settings.

Hovering the mouse over each command will show the description of each function!

FiveM Cache: Automatically cleans Fivem cache, fixes drop fps and display problems in general

Reshade Cleaner: Starts a tool that allows you to completely clean fivem from the installation of graphic mods that create problems, avoiding deleting everything and reinstalling, it also contains other cleaning functions for both FiveM and Windows.

Windows Cleaner: Eliminate temporary files, useless logs that take up space and slow down Windows Explorer.

Teamspeak Cleaner: Cleans logs reclaiming space and reducing app crashes.

Fix Saltychat: The functions solve both the failed transition from "out of town" to "in town" which does not happen automatically when you enter the town, and the association of the saltychat plugin which is no longer recognized by Ts, making installation impossible .

Boost CPU and RAM: decreases the overall load on the cpu for those suffering from 100% load while gaming, and in parallel increases both intel and amd cpu performance by 20/30% by disabling the Specter and Meltdown security patches that only slow down the gaming system.

Commands Fix: restore the commands on Fivem, solve the bug that some players experience on other servers of the clothes wheel that doesn't work properly, solve the problem of the fixed pointer in the center of the screen, solve problems with the radio and menu commands with a simple click!

> **Note**
> You need to have TeamSpeak and FiveM installed in the default directory!
